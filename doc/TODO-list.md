# kpointers: TO-DO list

## Must have

- Publish blog about KPointers in personal blog

## Important

- Try to publish about KPointers in DZone

- Implement speed tests for JMH:

  - Prove pointers are as fast or faster than using arrays.

- Document important feature: Java arrays can't have more than MAX_INT elements, whereas KPointers arrays are only limited by memory space

## Nice to have

- Enhance merchandising: change logo for branding (_kpointers_for_kotlin.png_) and the main _README.md_ logo (_README/headerImage.png_)

- Regenerate automatically generated source files when the _ftl_ or the _json_ configuration files change
